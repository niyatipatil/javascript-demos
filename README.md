# JavaScript Demos Repository

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript code snippets demonstrating various concepts and functionalities. Below are brief descriptions of the code snippets included in this repository:

## Objects
1. **Object Mutability**: Demonstrates how objects in JavaScript are mutable and allow changes to their properties. It also contrasts this with arrays, which are immutable.
2. **Interpolation**: Shows how string interpolation works in JavaScript using template literals.
3. **Nested Object**: Illustrates the concept of nested objects within JavaScript objects and accessing nested properties.

## Strings
- **String Methods**: Provides examples of common string methods in JavaScript such as `indexOf`, `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase`, `length`, and `replace`.
- **Typecasting**: Demonstrates typecasting in JavaScript using the `Number` constructor.

## Functions
- **Local and Global Scope**: Highlights the difference between local and global scope in JavaScript functions.
- **Function as a Value**: Introduces functions as values within JavaScript objects, showing how they can be accessed and executed.

## Constructor Function
- **Constructor Function**: Explains the use of constructor functions in JavaScript to create objects with shared properties.

## Event Loop
- **Understanding Event Loop**: Provides insights into the event loop and asynchronous JavaScript execution using `setTimeout`.

## Scopes
- **Block Scope**: Demonstrates block scope in JavaScript using `let` and `var` declarations.

## README
